-  Hi, I’m @Notapsychopath
-  I’m currently learning React JS
-  I'm not skilled enough to collab on projects, so if I uploaded something to yours feel free to tell me what I did wrong.
-  Also still trying to figure out how github works. 

<!---
Notapsychopath/Notapsychopath is a ✨ special ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.
You can click the Preview link to take a look at your changes.
